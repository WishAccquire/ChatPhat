## 🌐 Deployment Details

This project is deployed on **Render**:  
**[https://chatphat.onrender.com](https://chatphat.onrender.com)**

- The deployment uses a free Render service, which may cause some features to load slowly or go to sleep after inactivity.
- Some advanced features (such as real-time file execution) may not work as expected on the deployed version due to Render’s limitations (cold starts, resource limits, or lack of persistent file system).
- **All features work perfectly on localhost.**  
  If you want to experience the full functionality, please run the project locally by following the setup instructions below.
